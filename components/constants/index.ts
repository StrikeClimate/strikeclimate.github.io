    problemTitle: "Problem",
    problemContent: "Nigeria experiences severe flooding every year, affecting agriculture, infrastructure, and human lives. Traditional forecasting methods lack accuracy, and communities receive warnings too late.",
    solutionTitle: "Solution by",
    solutionContent: "Developed an AI-driven flood prediction model using satellite imagery and hydrological data from sources like NASA, NOAA, and Sentinel-1. Integrated real-time rainfall and river discharge data to improve flood forecasts. Built a mobile/web platform where users receive early flood warnings and emergency response recommendations.",
    impactTitle: "Impact",
    impactContent: "Improved flood preparedness by providing 72-hour early warnings with 85% accuracy. Reduced economic losses by enabling communities to take preventive measures. Helped government agencies and NGOs allocate resources more effectively.",

    problemTitle: "Problem",
    problemContent: "Over 80 million Nigerians lack access to reliable electricity, especially in rural areas. Renewable energy (solar, wind) offers a solution, but poor site selection and design often lead to inefficient energy production.",
    solutionTitle: "Solution by",
    solutionContent: "Used geospatial data and AI to identify optimal locations for solar and wind farms based on sunlight, wind speed, and terrain analysis.Developed a predictive energy demand model to match supply with community needs. Designed a microgrid management system to ensure efficient power distribution.",
    impactTitle: "Impact",
    impactContent: "Increased renewable energy efficiency by 30-50% through better siting and grid management. Helped investors and energy companies optimize deployment strategies. Improved electricity access for thousands of off-grid households.",

    problemTitle: "Problem",
    problemContent: "Nigeria loses over 350,000 hectares of forest every year due to illegal logging, urban expansion, and agriculture. Monitoring deforestation in real time is difficult due to limited ground-based observation capacity.",
    solutionTitle: "Solution by",
    solutionContent: "Developed an AI-driven deforestation detection system using high-resolution satellite imagery (Sentinel-2, PlanetScope). Used deep learning algorithms to detect forest loss and illegal logging activity. Integrated an alert system that notifies conservation agencies when deforestation hotspots are detected.",
    impactTitle: "Impact",
    impactContent: "Provided real-time insights to government agencies and environmental organizations to combat deforestation. Increased efficiency in tracking illegal logging by 70%. Supported efforts to restore degraded lands through targetedÂ reforestation.",
