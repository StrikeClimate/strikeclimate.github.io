    problemContent: "Nigeria experiences severe flooding every year, affecting agriculture, infrastructure, and human lives. Traditional forecasting methods lack accuracy, and communities receive warnings too late.",
    solutionTitle: "Solution by StrikeClimate",
    solutionContent: "Developed an AI-driven flood prediction model using satellite imagery and hydrological data from sources like NASA, NOAA, and Sentinel-1. Integrated real-time rainfall and river discharge data to improve flood forecasts. Built a mobile/web platform where users receive early flood warnings and emergency response recommendations.",
    impactTitle: "Impact",
    impactContent: "Improved flood preparedness by providing 72-hour early warnings with 85% accuracy. Reduced economic losses by enabling communities to take preventive measures. Helped government agencies and NGOs allocate resources more effectively.",
